# Hotel-Rental-System
1. Assignment assigned by the university (Asia Pacific University)
2. It is a fully rental system that are only accessible by the admin.
3. Few assumptions are made during development of the system:
  - all users share 1 admin account
  - payment are made upon physical way
  - no cancel booking features, has to manually delete booking through the system.
4. Entire system was coded under the 4 major OOP concept of Java.
5. Run the HotelReservationSystem.java to see the system

#Further Improvement
1. Create register functions for future users.
2. Develop a Customer Interface for Booking purposes.
3. Build a payment gateway/top-up system for the customers.
4. Maybe you can add more of your own idea for future development xD?

### jdatepicker has to add into the project library as it is an external library
